                From 1990 to 1994 the tithe of tithes was shared among some
                mission agencies. The fund was sent to the headquarters of these
                agencies as general support to their work. However the church
                leadership soon thought that the field based missionaries needed
                the money more than their headquarters. From 1995 the mission
                fund was now used to support field based missionaries. It was
                also decided at that time that the support would be in phases of
                three years. <br />
                <br />
                During this period the money was sent as monthly stipend to the
                missionaries. The missionaries were all nominated from and by
                several mission agencies. The income of the church was not much
                at that time. So we could only afford to pay each missionary
                five hundred Naira per month. It was regarded as partial support
                to augment whatever other support they were receiving from
                elsewhere, hence the name &quot;Partial Missionary Sponsorship
                program&quot;. When PMSP entered its second phase (1998-2000),
                the income of the church had begun to increase. <br />
                <br />
                Consequently, the stipend of the missionaries was increased to
                seven hundred and fifty Naira per month. The number of
                missionaries and mission agencies enjoying the support was
                increased by more than 100%. We also began sponsorship of
                missionary children. In subsequent phases, the number of
                missionaries and missionary children benefiting from the scheme
                further increased. The table below shows GT&apos;s progressive
                involvement in Missions.
