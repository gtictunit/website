                In July 1997, Dr. U. Obed attended the Global Consultation on
                World Evangelism in Pretoria, South Africa. On his return, he
                initiated the formulation of the church view on missions as
                follows:{" "}
                <i className="fw-light">
                  We believe that the current global emphasis on evangelizing
                  the world by 2000AD (and beyond) is a divine initiative. We
                  also believe that the most effective way of achieving this
                  goal is by aggressive missionary work. It is therefore our
                  desire in the Glory Tabernacle Ministry to participate in this
                  final global thrust, by supporting mission endeavors.

                <br />
                <br />
                The church consequently adopted three of the critically
                unreached people groups in Nigeria on the Joshua Project. Three
                missionaries were selected and placed on special sponsorship.
                This gave rise to the program we now refer to as Special
                Missionary Sponsorship Program(SMSP). Each of the missionaries
                was placed on a stipend of five thousand naira per month. Since
                then we have had and still have several missionaries in
                critically unreached areas under our sponsorship. <br />
                <br />
                At this juncture, the Pastor encouraged individuals and teams in
                the church to get personally involved in mission support.
                Everyone was made to realize that this is an acceptable service
                to God, which has both temporal and eternal rewards. Any amount
                was acceptable as long as it will be given on a regular basis.
                Over 100 people made monthly pledges of between 50 and 5000
                naira. In addition, many teams (Ushers, Choir, Children,
                Deacons, Singles, etc.) in the church decided to sponsor one or
                more missionaries in the PMSP. <br />
                <br />
                Private businesses, Schools and other enterprises provided
                corporate contributions. Together with the tithe of tithes, more
                resources became available for mission support. In order to
                coordinate all these contributions and enhance the effective and
                fruitful use of the resources, the Mission Support Clearing
                House (MSCH) was set up. <br />
                <br />
                GT is divided into zones based on the grouping of our home cells
                (Discipleship Fellowship Centers). Each of these zones collects
                special missionary offerings at the home cells. With these
                offering they participate in the PMSP and carry out other forms
                of mission support. One of the zones has bought a motorcycle for
                a field based missionary.
